A simple application that I worked on to convert decimal base numbers into binary base numbers, octal, and hexadecimal. As for, some of the features that I made:
1. **Splash Screen**
2. **Light and Dark Mode**
3. **Blank Form Validation**
4. **Maximum input is only 3 characters**

Don't forget to try a simple application that I developed. Please also feel free to develop it even better. Most importantly, don't forget to give me good feedback and build it so that the future will be even better.
Thank you!
